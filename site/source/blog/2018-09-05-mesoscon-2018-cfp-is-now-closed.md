Thank you everyone for submitting proposals, our Call For Proposals is now closed.

We would like to communicate an important change: MesosCon 2018 will instead be held in the San Francisco area on November 5th-7th, 2018. The dates remain unchanged, but it will not be held in New York City as previously announced.

After much discussion, the majority of the community found that the Bay Area would be easier to attend. We apologize for this last minute decision and any inconvenience that it might cause you. We are trying to have a small satellite event in New York City, and are also trying to allow for remote participation where feasible.

## CFP Decision Timeline

Thank you again for everyone who submitted talks. We hope to inform each submitter by the end of September, and to announce the final format and venue at this time.

## Sponsor MesosCon

MesosCon is a community run conference and your support is needed. Sponsoring this event will provide a great opportunity for your organization to further engage with the Mesos community. [Contact us](mailto:sponsor@mesoscon2018.org) to learn more.

Help us make #MesosCon 2018 a big success by spreading the word!

Hope to see you at this year's MesosCon!
