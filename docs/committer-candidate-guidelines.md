# Apache Mesos Committer Candidate Guidelines

This document contains categories of contributions and behaviors relevant to
becoming an Apache Mesos committer. As a committer candidate you can use these
guidelines to gauge what you have achieved so far. Neither is this an exhaustive

diverse committer profiles. But some categories are always crucial to have
covered, e.g., writing high quality source code and performing meaningful code
reviews.
