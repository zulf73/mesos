[ERROR]: You are providing the path to ${_present}
through your environment but no reference to ${_missing}.
To fix this error please specify ${_missing} too.

As an example, if you are using automake-1.12 and have
available aclocal-1.12 you will want to do the following:

    AUTOMAKE="/usr/local/bin/automake-1.12" \\
    ACLOCAL="/usr/local/bin/aclocal-1.12"   \\
    ./bootstrap

Your current environment has:
    AUTOMAKE="$AUTOMAKE"
    ACLOCAL="$ACLOCAL"

        exit 1

else
    AUTOMAKE="$(which automake)"
